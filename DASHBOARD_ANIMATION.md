# Dashboard Number Animation Implementation

## Feature Added
Smooth counting animations for all dashboard numbers - they now count from 0 to their target value when the page loads!

## How It Works

### Custom Animation Hook
```javascript
useCountAnimation(targetValue, duration = 1500)
```
- Animates numbers from 0 to target
- Duration: 1.5 seconds
- Frame rate: 60fps (smooth)
- Returns: { count, isAnimating }

### Parsing System
Intelligently handles different value types:
- **Integers**: `36` â†’ Animates 0 â†’ 36
- **Decimals**: `10.5 km` â†’ Animates 0.0 km â†’ 10.5 km  
- **Time**: `45m` â†’ Animates 0m â†’ 45m

## Visual Effects

### During Animation (0-1.5s):
1. **Numbers**: Count up from 0, turn green, scale to 105%
2. **Icons**: Scale to 110% (pulse effect)
3. **Cards**: Elevated shadow on hover

### After Animation:
- Numbers return to gray color
- Icons return to normal size
- Everything is static and ready

## Example Animations

| Card | Animation |
|------|-----------|
| Total Trucks | 0 â†’ 5 â†’ 10 â†’ 15 â†’ 20 â†’ 25 â†’ 30 â†’ 36 |
| Avg Distance | 0.0 km â†’ 2.5 km â†’ 5.0 km â†’ 10.5 km |
| Avg Time | 0m â†’ 10m â†’ 20m â†’ 30m â†’ 43m |
