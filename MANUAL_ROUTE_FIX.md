# Manual Route Creation Fix

## Issue
Manual route creation was not working properly - the dummy collection bins were interfering with user-selected points during manual route creation.

## Root Cause
1. Dummy collection bins were visible during manual route creation mode
2. Bins were potentially clickable and interfering with map interactions
3. Auto-generate function was setting route creation mode ON, causing confusion

## Solution Applied

### 1. Hide Bins During Manual Route Creation
**File**: `apps/frontend/src/components/Map.js`

**Change**: Added `!isRouteCreationMode` condition to bin rendering
```javascript
// BEFORE:
{showDefaultPoints && dummyCollectionBins
  .filter(bin => bin.municipalCouncil === selectedArea)
  .map((bin) => { ... })}

// AFTER:
{showDefaultPoints && !isRouteCreationMode && dummyCollectionBins
  .filter(bin => bin.municipalCouncil === selectedArea)
  .map((bin) => { ... })}
```

**Result**: Bins are now ONLY visible when NOT in route creation mode

### 2. Clean State Management for Auto-Generate
**File**: `apps/frontend/src/pages/RouteOptimizationPage.jsx`

**Changes**:
1. Auto-generate now clears existing selections first
2. Keeps `isRouteCreationMode` OFF during auto-generation
3. Clears temporary points after route is saved

```javascript
const handleAutoGenerateRoute = () => {
  // Clear any existing manual selections FIRST
  setSelectedPoints([]);
  setGeneratedRoute(null);
  setCurrentRoadRoute(null);
  
  setIsGenerating(true);
  setIsRouteCreationMode(false); // Keep OFF for auto-generation
  
  // ... generate route ...
  
  // Clear temporary points after saving
  setSelectedPoints([]);
  setGeneratedRoute(null);
  setCurrentRoadRoute(null);
}
```

## Behavior Now

### Manual Route Creation (Click "Create New Route")
1. ✅ Route creation mode: ON
2. ✅ Bins: HIDDEN (not visible)
3. ✅ User clicks on map to add points
4. ✅ Only user-selected points are used
5. ✅ Depot shown as starting point
6. ✅ Route generated from user's exact selections

### Automatic Route Generation (Click "Auto-Generate Route")
1. ✅ Route creation mode: OFF
2. ✅ Bins: VISIBLE (for reference only)
3. ✅ System selects 10 closest bins automatically
4. ✅ Route generated and saved
5. ✅ Clears selections after completion
6. ✅ Ready for next operation

## Visual States

| Mode | Bins Visible | User Can Click Map | Depot Shown |
|------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Normal View** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (as municipal council) |
| **Manual Creation** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (green "D" marker) |
| **Auto-Generate** | ✅ Yes (temporarily) | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **After Save** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Route Creation
- [x] Click "Create New Route"
- [x] Bins disappear from map
- [x] Depot shows as green "D" marker
- [x] Click on map adds blue markers
- [x] Each click adds a point
- [x] Points show numbers (Order: 1, 2, 3...)
- [x] Click "Generate Route" creates route
- [x] Route uses ONLY user-selected points
- [x] Route starts and ends at depot

### Auto-Generate Route
- [x] Click "Auto-Generate Route"
- [x] System selects 10 bins automatically
- [x] Route generated without user interaction
- [x] Route saved to database
- [x] Points cleared after save
- [x] Ready for next operation

### Mode Switching
- [x] Can switch between manual and normal view
- [x] "Cancel Route Creation" clears points
- [x] Auto-generate doesn't activate creation mode
- [x] Manual mode isolates user from bins

## Key Improvements

1. **Clear Separation**: Manual and automatic modes are now completely separate
2. **No Interference**: Bins don't interfere with manual point selection
3. **Better UX**: Users see only relevant information for their current task
4. **Clean State**: Each operation starts with a clean slate
5. **Predictable**: Consistent behavior every time

## Technical Details

### State Management Flow

**Manual Creation:**
```
Click "Create New Route"
  ↓
isRouteCreationMode = true
  ↓
Bins hidden (!isRouteCreationMode check)
  ↓
User clicks map → adds points
  ↓
Click "Generate Route" → uses ONLY selectedPoints
  ↓
Save to database
  ↓
Clear and return to normal
```

**Auto-Generate:**
```
Click "Auto-Generate"
  ↓
isRouteCreationMode = false (stays off)
  ↓
Clear existing selections
  ↓
Filter bins by council
  ↓
Select 10 closest bins
  ↓
Convert to points format
  ↓
Generate route automatically
  ↓
Save to database
  ↓
Clear temporary points
```

## Files Modified

1. **apps/frontend/src/components/Map.js**
   - Line ~340: Added `!isRouteCreationMode` to bin rendering condition
   - Effect: Bins only visible when NOT in creation mode

2. **apps/frontend/src/pages/RouteOptimizationPage.jsx**
   - Line ~268: Clear states at start of auto-generate
   - Line ~270: Keep route creation mode OFF during auto-generate
   - Line ~345: Clear temporary points after save
   - Effect: Clean state management, no mode confusion

## Summary

The fix ensures that:
- ✅ Manual route creation uses ONLY user-selected points
- ✅ Dummy bins don't interfere with manual selection
- ✅ Auto-generate and manual modes are completely separate
- ✅ Clear visual feedback for each mode
- ✅ Predictable and reliable behavior

Both manual and automatic route creation now work independently and correctly!
